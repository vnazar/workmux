# AI agents

workmux is designed with AI agent workflows in mind. Run multiple agents in parallel, each in their own isolated environment.

## Agent integration

When you provide a prompt via `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or `--prompt-editor`, workmux automatically injects the prompt into panes running the configured agent command (e.g., `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `gemini`, `kiro-cli`, `vibe`, `pi`, `omp`, or whatever you've set via the `agent` config or `--agent` flag) without requiring any `.workmux.yaml` changes:

- Panes with a command matching the configured agent are automatically started with the given prompt.
- You can keep your `.workmux.yaml` pane configuration simple (e.g., `panes: [{ command: "<agent>" }]`) and let workmux handle prompt injection at runtime.

This means you can launch AI agents with task-specific prompts without modifying your project configuration for each task.

### Examples

```bash
# Create a worktree with an inline prompt
workmux add feature/auth -p "Implement user authentication with OAuth"

# Create a worktree with a prompt from a file
workmux add feature/refactor --prompt-file task-description.md

# Open your editor to write a prompt interactively
workmux add feature/new-api --prompt-editor

# Override the default agent for a specific worktree
workmux add feature/caching -a gemini -p "Add caching layer for API responses"

# Use -A to generate branch name from the prompt automatically
workmux add -A -p "Fix race condition in payment handler"

# Use -A alone to open editor for prompt, then generate branch name from it
workmux add -A
```

::: tip
The `-A` (`--auto-name`) flag uses an LLM to [generate a branch name](/reference/commands/add#automatic-branch-name-generation) from your prompt, so you don't have to think of one.

## Embedded agent mode

If your editor has a built-in agent (e.g., neovim with an agent plugin), you can use `--prompt-file-only` to write the prompt to `.workmux/PROMPT-<branch>.md` without requiring an agent pane:

```bash
workmux add feature/task -P task.md --prompt-file-only
```

Your editor can then detect the prompt file on startup and pass it to its embedded agent. Set `prompt_file_only: true` in `.workmux.yaml` to make this the default.

## Named agents

Define short names for agent commands in your global config. This is useful when you have multiple accounts, custom wrapper scripts, or commands with long environment variable overrides:

```yaml
# ~/.config/workmux/config.yaml
agents:
  cc-work: "claude"
  cc-personal: "env CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-personal claude"
  cc-bedrock: "env -u CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK -u AWS_REGION AWS_PROFILE=prod claude"
  cc-yolo: "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
  cod: "codex --yolo"
```

Use named agents anywhere you'd use an agent name:

```bash
# CLI
workmux add feature/auth -a cc-work -p "Implement OAuth"

# In .workmux.yaml
agent: cc-work
```

workmux resolves the name to the full command at load time. The agent profile (prompt injection format, continue/resume flags, skip-permissions flags) is automatically detected from the resolved command, even through `env` wrappers.

For wrapper scripts where the executable name doesn't match a known agent, use the map form with an explicit `type`:

```yaml
agents:
  cc-smart:
    command: "/path/to/smart-picker"
    type: claude
```

::: tip
Named agents are global-only for security. Define them in `~/.config/workmux/config.yaml`, not in project `.workmux.yaml` files. Project configs can reference them but not define them.
:::

## Per-pane agents

workmux automatically recognizes built-in agent commands (`claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, `opencode`, `kiro-cli`, `vibe`, `pi`, `omp`) in pane commands. This means prompt injection works without the `<agent>` placeholder or a matching `agent` config:

```yaml
panes:
  - command: "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
    focus: true
  - command: "codex --yolo"
    split: vertical
```

Each agent receives the prompt using its native format (e.g., Claude uses `--`, Gemini uses `-i`). Auto-detection matches the executable name regardless of flags or path. Just provide a prompt via `-p`, `-P`, or `-e`.

See [pane configuration](/guide/configuration#agent-placeholders) for details.

## Named layouts with agents

Use [named layouts](/guide/configuration#named-layouts) to define reusable pane arrangements with different agent combinations:

```yaml
layouts:
  design:
    panes:
      - command: claude
        focus: true
      - command: codex
        split: vertical
  solo:
    panes:
      - command: claude
```

```bash
# Two agents side by side
workmux add my-feature -l design -p "Implement the new search API"

# Single agent
workmux add quick-fix -l solo -p "Fix the login bug"
```

When a layout is selected with `-l`, its panes replace the top-level `panes`. All other config (hooks, files, etc.) comes from the top-level as usual.

## Parallel workflows

workmux can generate multiple worktrees from a single `add` command, which is ideal for running parallel experiments or delegating tasks to multiple AI agents.

### Multi-agent example

```bash
# Create one worktree for claude and one for gemini with a focused prompt
workmux add my-feature -a claude -a gemini -p "Implement the new search API integration"
# Generates worktrees: my-feature-claude, my-feature-gemini

# Create 2 instances of the default agent
workmux add my-feature -n 2 -p "Implement task #{{ num }} in TASKS.md"
# Generates worktrees: my-feature-1, my-feature-2
```

See the [add command reference](/reference/commands/add) for all parallel workflow options.
