# Dashboard

When running agents in multiple worktrees across many projects, it's helpful to have a centralized view of what each agent is doing. The dashboard provides a TUI for monitoring agents, reviewing their changes, staging hunks, and sending commands.

::: info Optional feature
The dashboard is entirely optional. It becomes especially useful when running multiple agents across several projects, but workmux's core workflow works great on its own.
:::

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <img src="/dashboard.webp" alt="workmux dashboard" style="border-radius: 4px;">
</div>

For an always-visible, non-intrusive alternative, see the [sidebar](/guide/sidebar/).

## Setup

::: warning Prerequisites
The dashboard requires [status tracking hooks](/guide/status-tracking) to be configured. Without them, no agents will appear.
:::

Add this binding to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
bind C-s display-popup -h 30 -w 100 -E "workmux dashboard"
```

Then press `prefix + Ctrl-s` to open the dashboard as a tmux popup. Feel free to adjust the keybinding and popup dimensions (`-h` and `-w`) as needed.

::: tip Quick access
Consider binding the dashboard to a key you can press without the tmux prefix, such as `Cmd+E` or `Ctrl+E` in your terminal emulator. This makes it easy to check on your agents at any time.
:::

See [command reference](/reference/commands/dashboard) for CLI options.

## Views

The dashboard has two views, toggled with `Tab`:

- **Agents**: Shows all running agent panes with their status, git info, and live terminal preview
- **Worktrees**: Shows all git worktrees with branch, PR status, and agent summary. Press `r` to remove a worktree (kills agent, removes worktree, deletes branch).

## Columns

- **#**: Quick jump key (1-9)
- **Project**: Project name (from `__worktrees` path or directory name)
- **Agent**: Worktree/window name
- **Git**: Diff stats showing branch changes (dim) and uncommitted changes (bright)
- **Status**: Agent status icon (🤖 working, 💬 waiting, ✅ done, or "stale")
- **Time**: Time since last status change
- **Title**: Claude Code session title (auto-generated summary)

## Live preview

The bottom half of the dashboard shows a live preview of the selected agent's terminal output. The preview auto-scrolls to show the latest output, but you can scroll through history with `Ctrl+u`/`Ctrl+d`.

## Input mode

Press `i` to enter input mode, which forwards your keystrokes and pasted text directly to the selected agent's pane. This lets you respond to agent prompts without leaving the dashboard. Press `Esc` to exit input mode and return to normal navigation.

## Sort modes

Press `s` to cycle through sort modes:

- **Priority** (default): Waiting > Done > Working > Stale
- **Project**: Group by project name, then by priority within each project
- **Recency**: Most recently updated first
- **Natural**: Original tmux order (by pane creation)

Your sort preference persists in the tmux session.

## Session filter

Press `F` to toggle the session filter. When active, only agents in the current session are shown. This is useful for session-per-project workflows where each session maps to a repository. You can also start the dashboard with `--session` to default to session filtering. The preference persists across sessions.

## Stale filter

Press `f` to toggle between showing all agents or hiding stale ones. The filter state persists across dashboard sessions within the same tmux server.

## Sweep

Press `R` in either view to open sweep mode, which identifies worktrees ready for cleanup and lets you remove them in bulk. Worktrees are flagged based on these conditions:

- **PR merged**: The associated pull request has been merged
- **PR closed**: The pull request was closed without merging
- **Upstream gone**: The remote branch has been deleted
- **Merged locally**: The branch is fully merged into the main branch with no upstream tracking

The main worktree is never included.

Clean worktrees are pre-selected and can be toggled with `Space`. Dirty worktrees (uncommitted changes) are shown greyed out and cannot be selected. Press `Enter` to remove all selected worktrees, or `Esc` to cancel.
