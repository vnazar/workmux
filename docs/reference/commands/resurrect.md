description: Restore worktree windows after a tmux or computer crash

# resurrect

Restores worktree windows after a tmux or computer crash. Uses persisted agent state files to detect which worktrees had active agents before the crash, then reopens them with each agent's resume arguments.

```bash
workmux resurrect [--dry-run]
```

## Options

- `--dry-run`: Show what would be restored without actually doing it.

## How it works

1. Reads agent state files from `~/.local/state/workmux/agents/`
2. Filters to the current multiplexer backend and instance
3. Matches each state file's working directory to a git worktree in the current repo
4. Skips worktrees that are already open, no longer exist, or are the main worktree
5. Opens each matched worktree with the resume arguments for the remembered agent
6. Uses agent-specific behavior, such as Codex's resume subcommand with its last-session flag
7. Cleans up consumed stale state files

## Examples

```bash
# Preview what would be restored
workmux resurrect --dry-run

# Restore all worktrees that had agents running
workmux resurrect
```

## Example output

```
  continue-flag        -> restoring
  dashboard-fix        -> skipping (already open)
  auth-refactor        -> restoring
  (2 state file(s) from other projects ignored)

✓ Restored 2 worktree(s): continue-flag, auth-refactor
```
